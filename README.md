# Sketchpad
A simple sketchpad website

Basic javascript, html and css are done.

this project is not finished yet, is really ugly, It could have many more options, it doesn`t have a "clean grid" option yet, etc.

for now, it will stay this way because is the bare minimum the Odin Project ask for, once I finish the advanced courses and projects I will come back to add more features and polish the style so it looks decent. 

Things I want to add to future revision

An option to select the color, if possible even to choose the color gradient
A clear board option
A slide to select the number of squares per side instead of a pop-up
Better style of course, on the overall looks, the buttons, the slide, etc
An option to erase (change the color of the pencil to white)
Optimize the javascript to work better and to stop the bug where it sometimes keeps drawing when let the mouse button go
